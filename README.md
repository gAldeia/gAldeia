# Hello there :upside_down_face:

### About me

I'm Guilherme, graduated in Computer Science and Neuroscience, and currently, a Master's student at Universidade Federal do ABC. Since 2015, I've been involved with symbolic regression and machine learning methods, mainly from a theoretical perspective. I am passionate about math, computer science, and biology --- and probably that's why symbolic regression intrigues me.

### Languages

I've learned several languages throughout my academic life, some better than others. My main languages now are Julia and Python, the ones that I have a greater domain. Throughout my academic life, I also used other languages in my projects, such as R, C++, javascript, and Java.
