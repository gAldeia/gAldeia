# Hello there :upside_down_face:

### About me

I earned my PhD in Computer Science in November 2025 at the [Federal University of ABC (UFABC)](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/en/), in Santo André, Brazil. My research focuses on genetic programming and its applications in the health sciences, including symbolic regression, machine learning applied to fMRI data, and explainable artificial intelligence. More broadly, I am interested in evolutionary computation, interpretability in machine learning, and computational models of neural information processing.

I hold Bachelor’s degrees in Science and Technology (2019), Computer Science (2020), and Neuroscience (2023). I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at UFABC in early 2022 and continued there for my PhD (2022–2025).

In 2023, I was awarded a Doctorate Sandwich grant from [CAPES—Brazil](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br), which allowed me to spend six months as a visiting researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital / Harvard Medical School, working at the [cavalab](https://cavalab.org/).

### Languages

I've learned several languages throughout my academic life, some better than others. My main languages now are Julia and Python, the ones that I have a greater domain. Throughout my academic life, I also used other languages in my projects, such as R, C++, javascript, and Java.
